# Garbage Classification System - Week 2

This project is part of my internship with EduNet to build an image classification system for classifying garbage images into categories like cardboard, glass, metal, paper, and plastic.

## What I did in Week 2

- Prepared and organized the dataset with proper class folders.
- Computed and visualized class distributions in training, validation, and test splits.
- Built and trained an EfficientNetV2B2 model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Evaluated the model's performance and plotted accuracy and loss graphs.
- Tested the trained model on sample images.
- Created a Gradio interface for simple predictions (optional).

## Files Included

- `week2_garbage_classification.ipynb`: Notebook containing all the code and outputs.
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages required to run the project.
- `model.h5`: Trained model file .
- `sample_images_dataset/`: Sample dataset images .
